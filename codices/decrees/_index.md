{{< components/dropcap-paragraph "A decree is no mere statement - it is forged in the crucible of wisdom and sealed with the authority of the Ordos." >}} Each decree carries the weight of the stars, binding all Aetherii to its sacred edict. From the founding, or dissolution, of the Ordos to the principles of life within the collective, every decree is a testament to the will of Aetheris Nova.

While resolute in their authority, decrees are not immutable; they may be superseded or adapted as knowledge deepens and the needs of Aetheris Nova evolve. In their essence, decrees embody the pursuit of understanding and the governance of progress.
